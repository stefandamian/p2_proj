The application is based on actively checking the prices of different products from certain sites.
The app has a search bar that gives you the possibility to search for items that you want to buy. Based on your input, it will result in a list of items that are fitting your search. Those items can be selected to monitor the price in time.
After the selection is complete, the server will daily update the price if the product, showing you a chart of the changes of the price in time.
